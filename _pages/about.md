I'm a research enthusiast with a strong background in Product Security and over 13 years of experience in designing and driving secure-by-default software programs across the SDLC. I focus on Application Security, DevSecOps, Cloud Security, and Software Supply Chain Security. My work blends hands-on technical expertise with a strategic approach to securing software at scale.

Profile Summary
======
- Experience in secure architecture reviews, threat modeling (STRIDE, DREAD), secure code reviews, and vulnerability testing (SAST, SCA, DAST, BAS, penetration testing).
- Led DevSecOps initiatives by integrating security into CI/CD pipelines to enable early detection, policy enforcement, and continuous compliance.
- Developed and implemented Secure SDLC frameworks involving engineering, QA, product, and security teams.
- Mapped security controls to compliance frameworks such as PCI DSS, GDPR, ISO 27001, SOC 2, and NIST.
- Worked on securing AI/ML pipelines and APIs from adversarial threats and model poisoning.
- Background in cryptography, token security, network defense (IDS, IPS, firewalls), and runtime API protection.
- Built and led secure coding practices, AppSec training, and security champion programs.
- Involved in incident response, SIEM integration, vulnerability triage, and bug bounty programs.
- Domain experience across Payment, Airline, and Core Services platforms.

Areas of Expertise
======
- Application Security: SAST, DAST, SCA, BAS, API Security, OWASP Top 10
- Threat Modeling: STRIDE, DREAD, Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool
- DevSecOps Automation: CI/CD with GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, pre-commit hooks, IaC scanning
- Secure SDLC: Security throughout planning, design, development, testing, and deployment phases
- Cloud Security: AWS and Azure - including IAM, encryption, and threat modeling for containers and serverless
- Vulnerability Management: Pen testing, bug bounty triage, and remediation processes
- Compliance: PCI DSS, GDPR, ISO 27001, SOC 2, Privacy by Design
- Training and Governance: Secure development training, OWASP workshops, SSDLC governance
- Software Supply Chain Security: Build pipeline protection, dependency scanning, SBOM, provenance

Research Interests
------
- Threat modeling in CI/CD pipelines using STRIDE and attack trees
- Software Supply Chain Security: SLSA, SSDF, SBOM, provenance controls
- Security of LLM/AI applications: Prompt injection defense, model hardening, data integrity
- DevSecOps Maturity: Automating security across the build, test, and release lifecycle
- API Security and Testing: Adversarial testing and behavior-based protection
- Security Culture: Champion programs and secure-by-default development practices

Let's Connect
------
I'm open to collaboration on research, security tooling, and discussions around Application Security, DevSecOps, and Secure Software Development.
